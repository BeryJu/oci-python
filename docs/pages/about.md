# About

This is a basic Python implementation of the [opencontainers](https://github.com/opencontainers) specifications.
The intention is for you to be able to load or create different kinds of
manifests and objects using Python.

## Purpose

Most container technologies are implemented in GoLang, and while this
is great for server applications (concurrency! compiled binaries!) it may
not be ideal for everyone's use case. While these "other" use cases are a small
set, they tend to fall more heavily on academic users, and so I think it's
still important to provide tooling for that audience.

> If you build it, they will come!

I also truly believe that providing base libraries to generate complex
configurations like these can empower users to build many things - so
many more than I could anticipate in advance!
